  \item
    \textbf{(Honors) Calculus I - MATH-1610/1617 (Auburn University)}

    Topics covered: limits; the derivative of algebraic, trigonometric,
    exponential, and logarithmic functions; applications of the derivative,
    antiderivatives, the definite integral; applications to area problems;
    the fundamental theorem of calculus.

    For honors sections, students
    created a capstone project and presentation illustrating the application
    of calculus to their own field of study or interests.

  \item
    \textbf{Calculus II - MATH-1620 (Auburn University)}

    Topics covered: techniques of integration, applications of the integral,
    parametric equations, polar coordinates, vectors, lines and planes in space,
    infinite sequences, and series.

  \item
    \textbf{(Honors) Calculus III - MATH-2630/2637 (Auburn University)}

    Topics covered: vector-valued functions, partial derivatives,
    multiple integration, and vector calculus.

    For honors sections, students were assigned to research and present
    topics and examples during lecture (with optional assistance from the
    instructor).

  \item
    \textbf{Intermediate Euclidean Geometry I - MATH 5380 (Auburn University)}

    Topics covered: Fundamental concepts and theorems of Euclidean geometry,
    introduction to higher dimensions. Regular polygons and polyhedra,
    symmetry groups, convexity, geometric extremum problems. Geometric
    transformations and their invariants.
