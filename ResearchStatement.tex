With my experience in software development and entrepreneurship, I'm
often asked variations of a certain question. \textit{``Why go into academia in
lieu of a more lucrative career in industry?''} The reason is simple. While
there are several intriguing puzzles in industry to be solved, the primary
objective ultimately is profit. In comparison, as academics our foremost duty
is to research open problems, create new knowledge, and pass on this knowledge
through instruction and outreach, for the betterment of society.

My emerging career as a mathematical researcher is punctuated with several
results, invited talks, and a co-authored publication in Topology and its
Applications with several more papers in preparation. I am passionate not
only about the creation of my research, but
also about how we share and collaborate as 21st-century mathematicians. My
experience with the open web provides me with a unique perspective on academic
collaboration in the information age, which will be changing drastically
in the coming decade. In addition, I'm excited to apply my history of
leadership training and mentorship in order to guide young mathematicians
in their own research experience, beginning at the undergraduate level.


\section*{Undergraduate Research}

My calling to research began in my undergraduate career. Auburn University
(regrettably, in my opinion) does not require any sort of thesis or capstone
project of its undergraduate mathematics majors. Nonetheless, during my junior
year, I worked on some toy problems suggested by two professors at Auburn:
Phil Zenor in topology, and Andras Bezdek in geometry. While I would ultimately
return to topology for my graduate-level research, I was fascinated with a
very tangible and surprisingly deep question on the unfolding of polyhedral
surfaces into the plane, which eventually became the topic of my undergraduate
thesis written as part of the requirements to be recognized as a University
Honors Scholar \cite{UNDERGRAD}.

Suppose that a polyhedron can be cut along its edges and unfolded into
the plane; we refer to such an unfolding as a \term{net} of the polyhedron.
It is easy to construct polyhedra with non-convex faces which do not
yield a net. A classic example of a polyhedron with convex faces which does
not admit a net involves gluing so-called \term{witch's hats} to the faces
of a regular octahedron; however, this polyhedron is not convex
\cite{UNUNFOLDABLE}.

G. C. Shephard conjectured in 1975 that every convex polyhedron yields at least
one net \cite{MR0390915}. If it is surprising that this question had
not been explicitly posed previously, then it is perhaps more shocking that
such a seemingly simple statement remains open to this day. For a beginning
mathematician, this was an exciting opportunity to engage a research-level
problem which was accessible without graduate-level coursework.
Indeed, the basic premise requires no mathematical background to appreciate,
and I successfully applied and interviewed for undergraduate research
fellowships at the university and college levels.

My thesis investigated a small subclass of convex polyhedra which I denoted
\term{generalized pyramids}: the convex hull of two parallel polygons, one of
which may be degenerate and whose projection must lay within the other.
In addition to a survey of the problem of unfolding polyhedra, I outlined
two techniques for unfolding certain generalized pyramids, based upon
techniques which work for typical pyramids.

Due to my experience as an undergraduate researcher in mathematics, I gained
my initial excitement for discovering new mathematical ideas. But just as
importantly, I also learned a lot about how I would want to mentor other
undergraduate researchers beginning their own mathematical journeys.


\section*{Graduate and Current Research}

I remained at Auburn to pursue a fifth-year mathematics education program,
but ultimately committed full-time to mathematics, including coursework in
general topology and combinatorial game theory. Before beginning my doctoral
work, I wrote a masters thesis
under Gary Gruenhage surveying known applications of stationary subsets of
regular uncountable cardinals \cite{MASTERS}.

I was first introduced to infinite combinatorial games during a descriptive
set theory course. Eager to learn more, I translated a paper by G. Debs
\cite{MR817083} constructing a space for which the second player has a winning
strategy in the Banach-Mazur game, but not a winning tactical
strategy. This paper served as the inspiration for my doctoral work at
Auburn under Gary Gruenhage.

\subsection*{Abstract}

In my doctoral and current research, I have studied the applications of
limited information strategies in various topological games. Particular results
of note include:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item extending results of Peter Nyikos \cite{MR1031771} on limited
          information strategies in Gruenhage's open-point convergence game,
    \item answering a question of Nyikos \cite{nyikosProximalPreprint} showing
          that Bell's proximal game characterizes the class of Corson compact
          spaces (joint work with Gary Gruenhage \cite{MR3227201})
    \item characterizing strong Eberlein compactness with the existence of
          a tactical winning strategy for Bell's proximal game
    \item showing an example of a locally compact, non-metacompact space for
          which the first player has a winning strategy but no winning
          $k$-tactical strategy for Gruenhage's compact-point game
          \cite{MR752278}, and
    \item extending results of Telgarsky \cite{MR753073} and Scheepers
          \cite{MR1273523} to characterize
          game-theoretic strengthenings of the Menger property.
  \end{itemize}

\subsection*{Definitions}

Intuitively, an
\term{$\omega$-length game} involves two players exchanging \term{moves} by
selecting elements from a given set over the course of $\omega=\{0,1,2,\dots\}$
rounds. At the ``end'' of the game, the $\omega$-length sequence of choices
made by the two players
are inspected to see if it fits the game's \term{winning condition} for a
particular player; if so, that player wins, and if not, the opponent wins.
Rigorously, this may be modeled by a tuple $\<M,W\>$ where $M$ is the set of
moves from which the players may choose from, and $W$ is the set of
$\omega$-length sequences of moves
for which the first player wins the game, called the \term{winning playthroughs}
for the first player. Thus $M^\omega\setminus W$ would be the set of winning
playthroughs for the second player, as no ties are allowed.
The introduction of such games is commonly attributed to Gale and Stewart
\cite{MR0054922}.

A \term{topological
game} is an $\omega$-length game where the moveset $M$ is related to the
topological structure of a given space $X$.
Perhaps the most prolific example of such a game
is the \term{Banach-Mazur game} $\bmGame{X}$ played on a topological space $X$.
During each round of this game, each player must choose an open subset of all
previously played open sets, starting with player $\pl E$.
Player $\pl E$ wins the game if the intersection
of all the open sets is empty, and player $\pl N$ wins the game otherwise.

A function $\sigma:M^{<\omega}\to M$ is known as a \term{strategy} for a game
with moveset $M$: intuitively, it determines the moves for a player given
all the previous moves of her opponent. If there exists a strategy $\sigma$
such that a player $\pl A$ will always win a game $G$ while using it, then
we say $\sigma$ is a \term{winning strategy} and write $\pl A\win G$
(``$\pl A$ wins $G$''). (All finite-length games have a player with a
winning strategy; however, under $ZFC$ this need not
hold for an infinite game.) The presence or absence of a winning strategy for
a player in a topological game on $X$ characterizes
a topological property of $X$. For example, a space $X$ is \term{Baire}
(the countable intersection of open dense sets is dense) if and only if
$\pl E\notwin \bmGame{X}$.

Sometimes a player may not need to use the complete history of her opponent's
moves to win a game. We call such strategies
\term{limited information strategies}. A strategy
which only uses the latest move (last $k$ moves) of the opponent is called
a \term{tactical} (\term{$k$-tactical}) strategy, and if it is winning we
write $\pl A\tactwin G$ ($\pl A\ktactwin{k} G$). A strategy
which only uses the latest move (last $k$ moves, no moves) of the opponent
and the number of the current round is called a \term{Markov} (\term{$k$-Markov},
\term{predetermined}) strategy, and if it is winning we
write $\pl A\markwin G$ ($\pl A\kmarkwin{k} G$, $\pl A\prewin G$). A strategy
which uses the latest move of both players is called a \term{coding} strategy,
and if it is winning we write $\pl A\codewin G$. The presence or absence
of a winning limited information strategy for a player in a topological game
on $X$ may characterize a stronger property of $X$ than the one characterized
by a winning perfect information strategy. For example, $\pl N \win \bmGame X$
if and only if $\pl N \codewin \bmGame X$; however, $\pl N \tactwin \bmGame X$
if and only if $X$ is a \term{siftable} space (all siftable spaces are thus
Baire, but the converse does not hold). A famous question asks if for each
$k<\omega$ there exists $X_k$ such that $\pl N\ktactwin{k+1}\bmGame{X_k}$
but $\pl N\notktactwin{k}\bmGame{X_k}$. (The non-trivial example of Debs
referenced earlier witnesses $k=1$.)

For a more complete overview of the history of topological games, I recommend
R. Telgarsky's excellent survey dedicated to the Banach Mazur game's 50th
anniversary \cite{MR892457}.

\subsection*{Results and Open Questions}

G. Gruenhage introduced
the $\omega$-length game $\gruConGame{X}{x}$ such that during
each round the first player $\pl O$ chooses a neighborhood of $x$ in $X$, and
the second player $\pl P$ chooses a point within all the previously chosen
neighborhoods \cite{MR0413049}.
$\pl O$ wins this game if the points chosen by $\pl P$
converge to $x$. It's easy to see that if $x$ has a countable base,
then $\pl O \prewin \gruConGame{X}{x}$, and this in fact is
a game-theoretic characterization of first-countability at $x$. The well-known
class of $W$ spaces are the spaces for which $\pl O \win \gruConGame{X}{x}$
for all $x\in X$; all first-countable spaces are then $W$ spaces.

To investigate the limited-information setting for $\gruConGame{X}{x}$, we look
to non-first-countable $W$ spaces. Examples which I have studied include the
one-point compactification of a discrete cardinal
$\oneptcomp\kappa=\kappa\cup\{\infty\}$ and the
$\Sigma$-product of $\kappa$ real lines $\Sigma\mb R^\kappa$. (Note that
$\oneptcomp\kappa$ is a subspace of $\Sigma\mb R^\kappa$ where
$\infty\in\oneptcomp\kappa$ corresponds to $\vec0\in\Sigma\mb R^\kappa$.)

P. Nyikos first showed that
$\pl O\notmarkwin\gruConGame{\oneptcomp\omega_1}{\infty}$ when $\pl P$ is only
required to play within the latest open set played \cite{MR1031771}.
When $\pl P$ must play within all previously played open sets, I have shown
that $\pl O\notkmarkwin{k}\gruConGame{\oneptcomp\kappa}{\infty}$ for
$\kappa>\omega_1$ and
$\pl O\notktactwin{k}\gruConGame{\oneptcomp\omega_1}{\infty}$, but knowledge
of the round number in fact allows
$\pl O\markwin\gruConGame{\oneptcomp\omega_1}{\infty}$. When given the ability
to encode information within $\pl O$'s own previous move,
$\pl O\codewin\gruConGame{\Sigma\mb R^\kappa}{\vec0}$ for all cardinals
$\kappa$.

These results suggest analogous questions to those asked of the
Banach-Mazur game $\bmGame{X}$.

\begin{question}
  For any $k<\omega$, does there exist a space $X$ and point $x\in X$ such that
  $\pl O\kmarkwin{k+1}\gruConGame{X}{x}$
  but $\pl O\notkmarkwin{k}\gruConGame{X}{x}$?
\end{question}

\begin{question}
  Does $\pl O\codewin\gruConGame{X}{x}$ imply $\pl O\win\gruConGame{X}{x}$?
\end{question}

Recently, J. Bell introduced a related game $\bellConGame{X}$ for uniformizable
spaces \cite{MR3239205}. During each round of this game, $\pl D$ chooses an
entourage of the diagonal, and $\pl P$ chooses a point within the previous
entourage of the previous point.
$\pl D$ wins this game if either the points chosen by $\pl P$ converge,
or the intersection of the entourage neighborhoods have empty intersection.
Spaces for which $\pl D$ has a winning strategy
are said to be \term{proximal}.

Bell demonstrated that all proximal spaces
are $W$ spaces; I've extended this by showing that for any $k<\omega$,
a winning $2k$-Markov (resp. $2k$-tactical) strategy for Bell's game can be
used to construct a winning $k$-Markov (resp. $k$-tactical) strategy for
$\gruConGame{X}{x}$. In addition, if $X$ only has a single non-isolated point,
then a winning $k$-Markov (resp. $k$-tactical) strategy in either game can be
used to construct a winning $k$-Markov (resp. $k$-tactical) strategy in the
other game.

Compact subspaces of $\Sigma$-products of real lines are called
\term{Corson compact}. Since $\Sigma$-products of proximal spaces and
closed subspaces of proximal spaces are proximal, all Corson compacts are
easily seen to be proximal. I showed with Gruenhage in \cite{MR3227201} that
the converse also holds. To see this, we gave a non-trivial proof that when
$\pl D\win\bellConGame{X}$ and $X$ is compact, then
$\pl O\win\gruConGame{X}{H}$ for any closed subset
$H$ of $X$. This yields the desired result when combined with a lemma due to
Gruenhage in \cite{MR752278}: a
compact space is Corson compact if and only if
$\pl O\win\gruConGame{X^2}{\Delta}$, where $\Delta$ is the diagonal of $X^2$.

More recently, I have shown that $\pl O\tactwin\bellConGame{X}$ characterizes
\term{strong Eberlein compactness}.
Since $\pl O\markwin\gruConGame{X^2}{\Delta}$ characterizes \term{Eberlein
compactness} in the category of compact spaces, some natural questions arise
concerning the relationship between Bell's game and Gruenhage's game.

\begin{question}
  Does $\pl D\kmarkwin{k}\bellConGame{X}$
  characterize Eberlein compactness in the category of compact spaces
  for some $k$?
\end{question}

\begin{question}
  For what conditions on $X$ and types of limited information strategies
  can we conclude $\gruConGame{X^2}{\Delta}$ and $\bellConGame{X}$ are
  equivalent?
\end{question}

Another game related to $\gruConGame{X}{x}$ is $\gruKPGame{X}$. During each
round of this game, $\pl K$ chooses a compact set in $X$, followed by
$\pl P$ choosing a point outside every previously chosen compact set. $\pl K$
wins this game if the points chosen by $\pl P$ are locally finite in the
space. In the case that $X$ is locally compact, this is essentially the
same game as $\gruConGame{\oneptcomp X}{\infty}$ where neighborhoods of
$\infty$ in $\oneptcomp X=X\cup\{\infty\}$ are complements of compact sets
in $X$.

Gruenhage showed in \cite{MR858337} that for locally compact spaces,
$\pl K\tactwin\gruKPGame{X}$ if and
only if $X$ is metacompact, and $\pl K\markwin\gruKPGame{X}$ if and only if
$X$ is $\sigma$-metacompact. I've extended this to show that for locally
compact or Hausdorff compactly-generated spaces,
$\pl K\prewin\gruKPGame{X}$ if and only if $X$ is hemicompact.

In fact, for
locally compact or Hausdorff compactly-generated spaces, this game is
equivalent with respect to predetermined strategies to a variation
$\gruKLGame{X}$ where the second player is able to choose compact sets
instead of points. However, there exists an ultrafilter
$\mc F\in\beta\omega\setminus\omega$ such that the single-ultrafilter space
$\omega\cup\{\mc F\}$
is an example of a Hausdorff non-compactly-generated space with
$\pl K\prewin\gruKPGame{X}$ but $\pl K\notprewin\gruKLGame{X}$. Due to a lack
of counter-examples, it's natural to ask:

\begin{question}
  Does $\pl K\prewin\gruKLGame{X}$ imply $X$ is compactly generated?
\end{question}

Gruenhage suggested a consistent example of a locally compact non-metacompact
space for which $\pl K$ has a perfect information strategy which may allow
a winning $2$-tactical strategy for $\pl K$. However, I have shown that this
space does not allow a winning $k$-tactical strategy for any $k<\omega$, which
leaves the following question.

\begin{question}
  For locally compact spaces,
  does $\pl K\ktactwin{2}\gruKPGame{X}$ imply
  $X$ is metacompact?
\end{question}

Finally, I have investigated the classic topological game $\menGame{X}$
characterizing the \term{Menger} property.
In these games, $\pl C$ chooses an open cover of the space $X$,
and $\pl F$ chooses a subset of $X$ which is covered by a
finite subset of the open cover. $\pl F$ wins if the union of the chosen
subsets equals the space.

Telgarsky \cite{MR753073} and Scheepers \cite{MR1273523} provided proofs of
the fact that for metrizable spaces, $\pl F\win\menGame{X}$
characterizes $\sigma$-compactness. I have broken this down to show that
$\pl F\markwin\menGame{X}$ characterizes $\sigma$-compactness for regular
spaces, and a winning perfect information strategy can be used to construct
a winning Markov strategy for second-countable spaces.

Since a winning $(k+2)$-Markov strategy can always be used to construct a
winning $2$-Markov strategy, I have investigated the class of
non-$\sigma$-compact spaces for which $\pl F\kmarkwin{2}\menGame{X}$.
The one-point Lindel\"ofication $\oneptlind\omega_1=\omega_1\cup\{\infty\}$
of a discrete first-uncountable space (neighborhoods of $\infty$ have countable
complements) is a $ZFC$ example. Assuming an axiom $\alcompS\kappa$
independent of $ZFC$ for $\omega_1<\kappa\leq 2^\omega$
and introduced by Scheepers in \cite{MR1129143}
to study a set-theoretic game similar to $\menGame{\oneptlind\kappa}$,
I have shown that $\pl F\kmarkwin{2}\menGame{\oneptlind\kappa}$. Several
games similar to $\menGame{\oneptlind\kappa}$ can be won with a $2$-Markov
or $2$-tactical strategy assuming $\alcompS\kappa$, so the axiom may in fact be
necessary.

\begin{question}
  Does $\pl F\kmarkwin{2}\menGame{\oneptlind\kappa}$ imply $\alcompS\kappa$?
\end{question}

It also hasn't been shown if there exists a space which actually requires
perfect information for $\pl F$ to win $\menGame{X}$.

\begin{question}
  Is there a space $X$ with $\pl F\win\menGame{X}$ but
  $\pl F\notkmarkwin{2}\menGame{X}$?
\end{question}


\section*{Mathematical Research and Cyberinfrastructure in the 21st Century}

In addition to researching mathematics, I am also interested in the mechanics
of how we research and collaborate as mathematicians in the 21st century.
While we have made progress in recent years as journals move to make their
archives available online and sites like arXiv.org provide convenient platforms
for sharing preprints of cutting-edge results, we have yet to move beyond
inefficiently passing around virtual sheets of paper.

Mathematics research currently operates as a \term{waterfall} process: results
are found, results are written up in a paper (and possibly shared in a
preprint), this paper is submitted for publication, and following the refereeing
and copyediting process, the paper may be published and accepted by the
community. This workflow moves in one direction, and results in a static
product (occasionally with errors).

Thanks to the open web, we have the opportunity to adopt a more \term{agile}
workflow. This process is perhaps most
easily seen by looking at collaboration on open source software.
Social coding platforms like GitHub and BitBucket have given software
developers the ability to self-publish cutting-edge software projects for
review by and possible collaboration with the open source community. These
projects are tracked using revision control, with a public record of
contributions made to each project. The process of creating, reviewing, and
publishing such code is a continuous and democratic process, and results
in living projects which can be refined and expanded over time.

Mathematics is not words on a page. By opening ourselves up to the tools
of modern technology not only to assist with our research, but also with
the publication and collaboration of our research, we will be able to most
efficiently produce and share mathematical knowledge as we move forward in
the modern era. Projects such as the \textit{$\pi$-Base Topology Database}
(to which I am a contributor) and
\textit{Homotopy Type Theory: Univalent Foundations of Mathematics} \cite{hottbook}
(licensed under Creative Commons and accepting pull requests on GitHub)
anticipate this paradigm shift, and as more digital
natives grow up to be mathematicians, such tools and openness will be soon be
expected as a matter of fact. I am excited to continue innovating in this area,
not only as a mathematician and software developer, but also as a future faculty
member.
